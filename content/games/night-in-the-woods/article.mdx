This one gave me post-game depression

Some guy on reddit described *Night in the Woods* as “a game about being fucking 20”. The game tackles a number of very real topics - mental illness, the dying economy of rural towns, religion, loss of friends and family… The main theme which resonates throughout the game is the apprehension young people feel for the future. The realism of the characters and their issues means practically any young adult can relate to at least parts of *Night in the Woods*' writing.

The game is immediately appealing thanks to its cutesy art style. I was already in love with fan art for this game before I knew what it was about thanks to the great character designs. The tone set by the art along with the humorous writing keep the game from feeling miserable when it starts getting heavy.

The town of Possum Springs, though dotted with derelict storefronts, damaged by flooding, and unmistakable dying, nevertheless feels like home. The people you talk to everyday breathe life into the husk of a town. Little stories that move forward day by day and characters that pop in and out give motivation to explore. Paired with a pleasant soundtrack and stylised visuals, Possum Springs feels familiar and welcoming, which puts you right into Mae’s headspace at the start of the game.

Bea and Mae’s relationship is the highlight of the game. Childhood friends now distant, during the game, they reconcile, they reminisce, they argue, they hurt each other, and they grow closer. Mae and Bea are great friends, but the hardships in their lives have put a great strain on their friendship. For Bea, the loss of her mother and financial burdens; for Mae, her mental illness which caused her to drop out of college. A mutual lack of understanding is at the heart of their troubled relationship. Mae, who is unemployed and wakes up at four, doesn’t understand the burden of Bea’s responsibilities. Likewise, Bea doesn’t understand Mae’s mental issues.
In Proximity, Bea extends an olive branch by opening up to Mae, sharing her feelings of hopelessness and resentment at Mae dropping out. At Gregg’s apartment, Mae does the same by explaining her issues with derealization and anxiety. This feels like an appropriate conclusion: they have gained at least some understanding of each other’s issues and grown closer as a result. Though it may not offer a solution to these issues, the story does mend Mae and Bea’s friendship, giving the game a sense of closure.

Bea’s story also really drives home the troubles Possum Springs faces. Of the friend group, she is the one who feels the most trapped by the town. Her dreams of attending college are dashed when her mother dies, her family loses their house, and she has to work to take care of her widowed father. You really end up rooting for Bea because of how much she’s been screwed over, and it makes every happy moment she gets feel all the more sweet.

Gregg’s story is far weaker. Mae and Gregg’s relationship lacks the emotional core present in Bea’s story. They do not connect, struggle, or grow. They mostly mess around with some stupid robot. The story is about how Gregg must move on from his past and work towards his future with Angus. This fails to resonate because one, Gregg isn’t the protagonist, and two, the crimes Mae and Gregg commit are not sufficiently risky or immoral to sell the idea that Gregg is running away from his responsibilities. When Mae opens up to Gregg in the last act, it feels out of place because Mae’s own issues are irrelevant to Gregg's story.

At first, the game’s climatic moment feels lacking due to its seemingly tenuous relation to Mae. As she explains, her and her friends' involvement in the cult’s actions is coincidental. Mae struggles to explain the cosmic entity which haunts her, leaving her friends in just as much confusion as us. The ending requires more contemplation than the game gives time for, which left me without a sense of closure.

With more thought, I think the Black Goat works as a thematic element, though it could have been better integrated narratively. The cosmic horror serves as a bridge between the decline of Possum Springs and Mae’s own problems. It is emptiness, loss, meaninglessness - a personification of the issues that plague both her and the town. It’s not meant to be fully understood.

Viewed as a literal cause for Mae’s dissociative disorder, the Black Goat cheapens her story somewhat by making her mental health less personal to her. Thematically, it doesn’t matter what causes Mae’s mental illness. What matters is that the Black Goat offers Mae the opportunity to literally confront her demons and puts her on the first step to recovery.

Despite a few stumbles in pacing and plot, the reality of its writing imbues *Night in the Woods* with a sense of meaning which somewhat cheapens other games. It is an experience that, while not as engaging in the moment, resonates deeper and sticks around much longer. Also the main character is a cute cat.
