I have a contention with the common idea that Rain World is this uncaring, unfair survival simulator where the world isn’t built for me. The statement isn’t entirely true, in a way that betrays a contradiction in the game’s design. Here’s why I turned off Karma gates on my first playthrough of Rain World.

Rain World is two games - one is the ecosystem simulator that doesn’t care about me, where every day is an unfair struggle for survival. The second is a platformer with checkpoints & levels, not so far removed from Mario. There is a tension between these two styles.

At the heart of this tension is the Karma gates that separate levels. My slugcat has a Karma level. It goes up when I eat enough food for the day and hibernate; it goes down when I die. It’s a scoring system that measures and rewards survival skills - gates between levels require a certain Karma level to pass through. This is the game saying “You must be this good at survival to pass”. But Rain World isn’t just a survival game - it’s a platformer with structured progression - loosely structured, but structured still.

As an animal, I don’t care to go to the next area. A game’s progression is such that later areas should be harder than early areas. But an animal would avoid the increased risk. As long as there’s food and shelter, I’d rather stay in the easier area.. But as a player, I want to pass through the gate to progress the gameplay and story. The game itself wants me to progress as well, demonstrated by the generosity of food placements. This conflict of incentives can cause issues when the risk gets too high.

Here’s the most relevant example: The Underhang is part of the game’s most challenging platforming gauntlet. 15-20 screens of tricky jumps over bottomless pits and long-limbed horrors that chase every sound. Anybody on their first playthrough will die a lot trying to make it through the Underhang. When you finally reach a checkpoint at the end, you are presented with the next step in progression: a level 5 Karma gate. 

This is absurd, since most players will have had their karma plummet to nothing after repeated deaths in the Underhang. The game expects this, and so right outside the checkpoint, before the gate, is an abundance of free food. A back and forth process - wake up, eat, hibernate, raise your karma - repeated a few times, and I’m ready to go through the gate. But, that’s a process so silly, so removed from the survival aspect of the game, that I question why there’s a Karma gate here in the first place. Here is an instance of one system - the gates - coming against the game’s intended pacing of progression, and the solution is to undermine the “survival in an uncaring world” aspect that is so idiosyncratic to Rain World.

Of course, this dissonance was present the whole time. The entire Underhang was built for me. An animal does not seek out platforming challenges where its death is near guaranteed, and decaying superstructures rarely rust away into conveniently beatable platforming levels. The entire level is a challenge built to entertain me. While I’m motivated by my curiosity, the Slugcat’s motivation for coming this far is “a glowy thing pointed me this way.” Curiosity may kill the cat, but I think that means checking out a dark cave or something, not climbing several kilometers up a rusting metal tower to go hang out with the tentacular horrors.

The Underhang is the most extreme example, being one of the areas most focused on platforming, and one of the hardest at that. But this generosity, this nudging in the player’s favor, is all over the world. Food is often placed near shelters and gates, easily accessible in case I need to raise my karma by a couple levels. It undermines the entire point of the Karma system - it’s no longer a measure of survival skills if it’s so easy to raise Karma right before leaving an area.

Not that this should be made harder. The game does this because it understands as a player I want to go to the next area, see the new thing, progress the story. I don’t want to laze around in an area I’ve already been to grind my Karma level. If that area is too hard, I might not just stall my progress, but have to revert it entirely. Since food doesn’t respawn day to day, dying while trying to raise karma forces me to go further away from the gate.

No, on this, the game and I are aligned: Just give me the free food so I can move on, especially after a tough bit of platforming. If the game is already willing to do this, why doesn’t it take the better solution: simply remove the Karma gates. If the game will undermine their main purpose, the only reason they have to exist is to give direction. The starting zone has 3 exits, but 2 are behind high Karma gates. Most players will take the path of least resistance. There must surely be easier ways to do this. Difficult platforming or enemies to scare off inexperienced players, for example. The gates aren’t even hard blocker, since it is possible for a new player to raise their Karma high enough to pass. This is the value of the Karma gates: they suggest a progression order. That is not a meaningful enough contribution for the cost.

There’s already a motivation for surviving - the game only saves on successful hibernation. And there’s already a motivation for continuous success - the Passages that unlock after 5 cycles at max Karma. Something along these lines could further encourage the honing of survival skills. Perhaps more passages that require an increasing number of cycles at max Karma. Perhaps buffs for being max Karma - a stronger throw, a glow in the dark, the ability to see and hear things otherwise undetectable, or unintelligible. Perhaps the player could consume their Karma level, reset to zero, to allow a save without enough food. This would fit into the theme of Karma as a measure of asceticism.

Of course this problem is not nearly as significant for experienced players. I kept Karma Gates enabled on my subsequent playthroughs - except Spearmaster cause fuck that campaign. There is another issue with Karma though: the mechanical implementation undermines the narrative.

Warning: idiot’s understanding of Buddhism ahead

Karma in Rain World is a misnomer. It is not actually related to the Buddhist concept. In Buddhism, Karma is intentional action of the body, speech, mind, which has moral consequences. Good karma is rewarded by favorable rebirth in the cycle of samsara. 

Instead, Karma in Rain World relates to a different Buddhist concept - the Noble Eightfold Path. 
According to the Four Noble Truths:
- Dukkha: existence within samara is suffering
- Samudaya: suffering is caused by attachment and desire
- Nirodha: suffering can be ended by letting go of attachment
- Marga: The Noble Eightfold Path is the way to let go of attachment.

Thus by following the Noble Eightfold Path one can attain nirvana and escape samsara. One is kept in the cycle by the Three Poisons - ignorance, greed, aversion. From these stem all other hindrances, such as the Five Hindrances: Desire, ill will, sloth, worry, doubt. To follow the path is to overcome these.

In Rain World, the Ancients held a similar philosophy. They sought to escape the cycle of suffering through asceticism. The Karma symbols represent natural urges similar to the Three Poisons or Five Hindrances: common interpretations are violence, lust, greed, material attachment, self-preservation.

Karma represents one’s level of detachment from the world. An enlightened being with high Karma can detach themselves completely and escape the cycle of rebirth. A creature with low karma cannot escape, even through use of the all-obliterating Void Sea.

Having said all that - what the hell does that have to do with survival and opening gates?? Why does eating and sleeping make me more spiritually enlightened? Why do I need to have hibernated 10 days in a row before I can escape the cycle? Why – how does a door measure my level of worldly detachment? Isn’t the need to satiate your hunger exactly the kind of attachment that binds one to the world? Forget survival, I should have to starve myself 10 days in a row before escaping. 

Obviously, this is just a gameplay conceit. It’s not a big deal, especially since the entire concept is background lore most won’t see first hand. But it’s still disappointing how little cohesion there is between gameplay and themes. As a counterexample to drive the point home: The single instance where Karma in game acts the same as Karma in lore -the Artificer’s campaign. The Artificer, having lost their cubs to Scavengers, heads off on a God-sanctioned murder spree in revenge. If they complete this task by killing the Scavenger Chief, they will be permanently locked at the lowest level of Karma, unable to ascend. This is great - lust for revenge, hatred, driven by love and grief, there is no greater spiritual attachment to the world.

I’m less convinced the thematic issues are actually solvable so I’m not too beat up about it. I do think the concept of the Karma level is good, only I take issue with the Karma gates. Ultimately though this is a pretty pedantic problem and probably not worth writing so much about.

Also I will NOT go into the meaning of the word “Cycle” in Rain World, that’s for another day.
