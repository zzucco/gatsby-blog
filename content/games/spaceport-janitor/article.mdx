A delightfully weird game that thrives on vibes. *Diaries* crafts an utterly unique culture by just saying “yes” to everything. The world is a mix of sci-fi and adventure fantasy. Characters come in all shapes and sizes. Items range from weapons to electronics to spells. There are dozens of food items each more bizarre than the last. Paired with great sound design and a catchy soundtrack, the world of Diaries is an endless fascination.

You literally get lost in the world all the time. The combination of a small map, a web of winding paths and squares, and non-euclidean wrapping leads to a unique exploration experience. At first you are blindly stumbling around, and the small map size means you will constantly run into the same landmarks without knowing how you got there. Despite the tiny size of the map, even after hours I only started to feel comfortable navigating the streets. Being able to reliably navigate around the map is super rewarding, but no matter how long you play it's impossible to form a proper mental map. Even when you can find your way, you always have that sense of getting lost and exploring.

The idea of exploring this rich microcosm of the universe while doing nothing but picking up trash was instantly intriguing to me. Surprisingly, there’s a good amount of depth in the gameplay. When you’re never more than one or two bad days from going broke, you need to maximise every possibility to make money. That means learning which items can be sold to which vendors, where each of the shrines and lottery machines are. By the end, you feel like something of a merchant yourself.

The presentation evokes a sense of childlike glee. Character sprites are simple and silly. The entire world is brightly coloured. Children’s voices sing festival songs. It makes the spaceport a positive space to exist in. In this way, *Diaries* is a comfort game - something that's just nice to soak in. Ironic, considering how it's about the crippling hopelessness which capitalism imposes on those at the bottom of the economic food chain. Though the sanidrone is constantly treated like shit and wants nothing more than to leave this life behind, I can’t help but feel like the spaceport is my home. It's where I belong, and during the late nights when festival music is blaring, it's where I want to be.
